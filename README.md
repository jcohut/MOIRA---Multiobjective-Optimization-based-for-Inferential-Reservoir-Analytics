# MOIRA---Multiobjective-Optimization-based-for-Inferential-Reservoir-Analytics

Releasing algorithm for inferential reservoir analytics based on multiobjective optimization technique.

The algorithm, given production data of wells, can infer the communication between wells, potential boundaries such as fault, and find conflicting well to optimize the production from the field.
